Restrictive, low-density zoning and gentrification have led to the displacement of many income-constrained Charlottesville residents. Local journalists are the primary information sources for residents about the crisis, but public data quantifying crisis impacts are often inaccessible to the public and to local media due to the technical experience required for data access and analysis. As a result, residents seeking to understand the landscape of housing in Charlottesville are not taking full advantage of the information contained within public datasets as rezoning discussions take place. The focus of this project is to create a public dashboard in cooperation with local journalists to display and contextualize Charlottesville housing affordability data. Figures included in the dashboard make use of publicly available data from the Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) Project, and Charlottesville Open Data Portal, which have been cleaned, joined, and aggregated for plotting. The dashboard displays maps that geographically visualize home rental and purchase prices and identify the locations of resources such as public transportation and grocery stores,  animated bar charts representing historical demographic information from the Census, and line graphs of historical median home prices. Neighborhood development is a central focus. We hope this platform for contextualizing and communicating data through data journalism will support advocacy for affordable housing initiatives and encourage more data scientists to carry out similar projects highlighting trends in their own communities.","tags":["Conference Talk","IEEE","SIEDS"],"title":"Democratizing Housing Affordability Data: Open Data and Data Journalism in Charlottesville, VA","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bozsik, Spencer","Cheng, Xinlun","Kuncham, Malvika ","Mitchell, Evan"],"categories":[],"content":"The paper will be available through IEEE in July 2022.\n","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"2170a5bc169f3963c5bbd8b46bc5cfbf","permalink":"https://jianjiangao.github.io/publication/2022sieds/","publishdate":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022sieds/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper will be available through IEEE in July 2022.","tags":["Large Magellanic Cloud","Galaxy interactions","Galaxy kinematics"],"title":"Democratizing Housing Affordability Data: Open Data and Data Journalism in Charlottesville, VA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheng, Xinlun","Choi, Yumi","Olsen, Knut","Nidever, David L.","Majewski, Steven R.","Monachesi, Antonela","Besla, Gurtina","Muñoz Gonzalez, Cesar","Anguiano, Borja","Almeida, Andres","Muñoz, Ricardo R.","Lane, Richard R.","Nitschelm, Christian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"eeec0421e27cde093cc631ce29848fc7","permalink":"https://jianjiangao.github.io/publication/2022apj...928...95c/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022apj...928...95c/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Large Magellanic Cloud","Galaxy interactions","Galaxy kinematics"],"title":" Kinematical Analysis of Substructure in the Southern Periphery of the Large Magellanic Cloud ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheng, Xinlun","Choi, Yumi","Olsen, Knut","Nidever, David L.","Majewski, Steven R.","Monachesi, Antonela","Besla, Gurtina","APOGEE Team"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634122800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634122800,"objectID":"c99bfa234aa5bcd5c369d6d6f4e6428f","permalink":"https://jianjiangao.github.io/talk/oct2021_apogeesciencecall/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/oct2021_apogeesciencecall/","section":"talk","summary":"We report the first 3-D kinematical measurements of stars in the direction of several recently discovered substructures in the southern periphery of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using a combination of Gaia proper motions and radial velocities from the APOGEE-2 survey.  More specifically, we explore stars that lie in assorted APOGEE-2 pointings in a region of the LMC periphery where various diffuse or stream-like overdensities of stars have previously been identified in maps of stars from Gaia and DECam; some of the APOGEE-2 pointings were deliberately selected to overlap these overdensities. By means of a comparison to a model of the LMC disk rotation, we find that a sizeable fraction of the APOGEE-2 stars have extreme space velocities that are distinct from, and clearly not a simple extension of, the LMC disk. Using N-body hydrodynamical simulations of the past dynamical evolution and interaction of the LMC and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), we explore whether the extreme velocity stars may be accounted for as LMC and/or SMC tidal debris created in the course of that interaction. We conclude that the combination of LMC and SMC debris produced from their mutual interaction is a promising explanation for the extreme velocity stars observed, although we cannot rule out other possible origins, and that these new data should be used to constrain future simulations of the LMC-SMC interaction. We also conclude that many of the stars in the southern periphery of the LMC lie out of the LMC plane by several kpc. Given that the chemistry of these stars suggest they are likely of Magellanic origin, our results suggest that a wider exploration of the past interaction history of the Magellanic Clouds is needed.","tags":["Research Talk","APOGEE"],"title":"Kinematical Analysis of Substructure in the Southern Periphery of the Large Magellanic Cloud","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Cheng, Xinlun","Anguiano, Borja","Majewski, Steven R.","Hayes, Christian","Arras, Phil","Chiappini, Cristina","Hasselquist, Sten","APOGEE Team"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610283600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610283600,"objectID":"656fdec0a96ace7e3709683fe34f0409","permalink":"https://jianjiangao.github.io/talk/jan2021_aas237/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/jan2021_aas237/","section":"talk","summary":"Previous studies of Milky Way stars have revealed that our Galaxy has a warped stellar disk, however, most of these studies have necessarily been confined to relatively nearby stars due to the challenge of deriving accurate stellar distances beyond the local volume.
